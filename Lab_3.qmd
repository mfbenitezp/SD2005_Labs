# Mapping Meaningful Places in Your Community - Lab Tutorial

## Overview
In this lab, you will learn to identify and map meaningful places in your community using ArcGIS Survey123. This project involves designing a research study, collecting data through surveys, and analyzing the results to understand what places contribute to your community's identity and resilience.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Design a research project with clear objectives and methodology
- Create digital surveys using ArcGIS Survey123
- Collect and analyze spatial data about community places
- Visualize data patterns using heat maps and other analytical tools
- Draw conclusions about community identity and important places

## Part 1: Design Your Project

### Step 1: Formulate a Research Question
Before collecting any data, you need to establish a clear research question that will guide your entire project. Your research question should address: Why are you collecting data? What do you want to know?

**Task:** Write a research question to guide your project about important places in your community.

**Examples:**
- What places in my community have social, economic, and political value and add to my community's identity?
- What places in my community contribute to its identity?

**Scottish Context Examples:**
- What places in Edinburgh contribute most to the city's cultural identity beyond the obvious tourist attractions?
- How do community spaces in Glasgow neighborhoods support local resilience and social cohesion?
- What locations in the Scottish Highlands are most valued by local residents for their cultural and economic importance?

### Step 2: Plan Your Data Collection
Now that you have your research question, consider what kinds of data you need to collect. Think about the who, what, when, where, and why of your data collection.

**Task:** Write five sample questions that you can use to collect data to answer your research question.

**Example Questions:**
- What is the name of this place?
- Why is it important to you?
- What activities do you do at this place?
- How often do you visit here?
- Who is there with you?
- How many people are typically there with you?

### Step 3: Consider Data Types
Different types of questions collect different types of data (numbers, text, dates, rating scales, images). Planning your data types in advance will make analysis easier later.

**Task:** Write 5-8 survey questions, keeping in mind your research question and the types of data you want to collect about each location.

**Sample Survey Questions Table:**

| Question | Options | Data Type |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| What is the name of this place? | | Text |
| Where is this place? | | Map |
| What kind of place is this? | School, Neighborhood, Park or open space, Library, Market, Shopping center, Religious space, Community center, Memorial or historic site, Restaurant, Performing Arts space, Other community space | Single select |
| How do you interact with this space? | To spend time with family, To spend time with friends, To exercise, For recreation, To shop, To learn, To worship, Other | Multiple select |
| How important is this place to you? | | Rating |
| How many times per week do you visit this place? | | Number |
| What kinds of challenges might this place face? | Climate threats and adaptability, Funding challenges, Land use change and development, None | Multiple select |
| Upload a photo of this location | | Image |

**Scottish Context Examples:**
- For "What kind of place is this?" you might add: Village hall, Distillery, Castle/Historic site, Farmers market, Pub, Community sports club, Gaelic cultural center
- For challenges: "Highland depopulation," "Tourism pressure," "Language preservation needs," "Weather-related access issues"

### Step 4: Determine Sample Size
Consider how many responses you need to answer your research question effectively. Also consider potential data bias - does your sample represent the population you're trying to understand?

**Task:** 
- Decide how many data points you need to collect and from how many different people
- Set a goal as a class for how many data points you need to collect and how many people you should survey

**Important Note:** Be aware of data bias. If you only survey your classmates, your data will tell you what's important to people your age, but may not represent the broader community.

3. On the Edit tab, for Label, type "What is the name of this place?"
4. For Validation, check the box for "This is a required question"

#### Add Map Question
1. In the Add pane, find the **Map** question type and drag it into the survey pane below the first question
2. For Label, type "Where is this place?"
3. For Hint, type: "Keep in mind with maps that some information is personal: you probably shouldn't share your home's location nor other personal locations. But you can safely share locations like your city or a major intersection."
4. For Drawing tools, make sure **Point** is selected
5. For Map and extent, type the address of your school and press Enter, or zoom and pan until you find your campus
6. For Default location, choose "Center of the map extent specified above"
7. For Validation, check the box for "This is a required question"

#### Add Additional Questions
1. Click the **Add** tab and add the rest of the questions you've formulated
