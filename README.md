# About this repo

This repo contains a book quarto book that has been developed as part of the module SD2005 â€“ From Sustainable Development to Human Security at the School of Geography and Sustainable Development, University of St Andrews. It includes a set of five practical labs designed to introduce students to essential skills in geographic information systems (GIS), using ArcGIS Onlineâ€”one of the most widely adopted Cloud-based GIS platforms in both academia and industry.

The SD2005 module includes a variety of lectures from different types of topics, but also includes two weeks and six lectures related to the use of spatial data in the study and monitoring of the SGDs. The labs included here have been tailored to complement the moduleâ€™s lecture content on spatial data, sustainable development, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The material and instructions here are an adapted version of several tutorials from Esriâ€™s Learn ArcGIS resources. 

All students enrolled in SD2005 have access to the Universityâ€™s ArcGIS Online Organisational Account using their University credentials. To get started, please log in at: ðŸ‘‰ https://uostandrews.maps.arcgis.com
