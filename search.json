These layers are also the basis for geographic analysis to aid in decision making. You will create a map layer by adding your .csv file to an empty map.\n\nSign in to your ArcGIS account using your university credentials.\nOn the ribbon, click the Map tab.\nIn Map Viewer, in the Layers pane, click the arrow next to the Add button and click Add layer from file.\n\n\nThe Add Layer window appears.\n\n\nDrag the DetroitSchoolCharacteristics.csv file to the Add Layer window.\n\n\nTip: Alternatively, click Your device and browse to the .csv file.\n\n\nFor How would you like to add this file, choose Create a hosted feature layer and add it to the map. Click Next.\n\nA list of fields appears. Map layers consist of spatial and tabular information. The table will contain the same columns—also called fields or attributes—as the .csv file. On this page, you can choose which fields from the .csv file you want to include, provide display names, and data type information.\nThe software automatically detected the fields and produced default display name and data types. This page is an opportunity for you to review that the automatic assignments are accurate.\n\nIn this example, you will choose to include all the fields, so you won’t adjust the check boxes.\nDisplay name sets a nickname or shortened name of the field name that is more readily understandable to others. Field names cannot include spaces or numbers, so sometimes you may want these in the display name. Setting Display name allows you to provide meaningful names without changing the Field name text.\nType describes the data you will store in the field: - Date—Date and time. - Double—Numbers with decimal places. - Integer—Whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (long integer). - Big Integer—Whole numbers between -(2^53) and 2^53. - String—Any sequence of characters. The default length is 256 characters.\nYou will accept all the default settings and continue.\n\nClick Next.\n\nThe Location settings page appears. Spatial information for the layer will be derived from the Latitude and Longitude columns in the .csv file.\n\nNote: If your table contains the names or addresses of locations (like Paris or 15 Central St. Bethlehem, PA) instead of latitude and longitude fields, try this tutorial about geocoding data: Convert a list of historic places into a map.\n\n\nClick Next.\nFor Title, type “Detroit high schools” followed by your name or initials (for example “Detroit high school (Your name)”).\n\n\nNote: You cannot create two layers in an ArcGIS organization with the same name. Adding your initials to a layer name ensures that other people in your organization can also complete this tutorial. Once a layer has been created, you can rename it in the map to remove your initials, which will not affect the name of the underlying data layer.\n\n\nClick Create and add to map.\n\n\nThe new layer appears on the map. The map displays the locations of the schools listed in the .csv file. Each school is considered a feature in the layer. You have access to the descriptive information, or attributes, by viewing pop-ups for features on the map.\n\nOn the map, click any circle.\n\nA pop-up window appears with information about the school from the layer’s table.\n\nClose the pop-up.\n\n\nBefore you continue, you will save the map.\n\nIn the Contents pane, click Save and open and click Save as.\n\nIn the Save map window, enter the following:\n\nFor Title, type “Public high schools in Detroit”.\nFor Summary, type “Map of public high schools and student body race and ethnicity data in Detroit, Michigan”.\n\n\nClick Save.",

    "text": "1.3 Part 1: Design Your Project\n\n1.3.1 Step 1: Formulate a Research Question\nBefore collecting any data, you need to establish a clear research question that will guide your entire project. Your research question should address: Why are you collecting data? What do you want to know?\nTask: Write a research question to guide your project about important places in your community.\nExamples: - What places in my community have social, economic, and political value and add to my community’s identity? - What places in my community contribute to its identity?\nScottish Context Examples: - What places in Edinburgh contribute most to the city’s cultural identity beyond the obvious tourist attractions? - How do community spaces in Glasgow neighborhoods support local resilience and social cohesion? - What locations in the Scottish Highlands are most valued by local residents for their cultural and economic importance?\n\n\n1.3.2 Step 2: Plan Your Data Collection\nNow that you have your research question, consider what kinds of data you need to collect. Think about the who, what, when, where, and why of your data collection.\nTask: Write five sample questions that you can use to collect data to answer your research question.\nExample Questions: - What is the name of this place? - Why is it important to you? - What activities do you do at this place? - How often do you visit here? - Who is there with you? - How many people are typically there with you?\n\n\n1.3.3 Step 3: Consider Data Types\nDifferent types of questions collect different types of data (numbers, text, dates, rating scales, images). Planning your data types in advance will make analysis easier later.\nTask: Write 5-8 survey questions, keeping in mind your research question and the types of data you want to collect about each location.\nSample Survey Questions Table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nOptions\nData Type\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the name of this place?\n\nText\n\n\nWhere is this place?\n\nMap\n\n\nWhat kind of place is this?\nSchool, Neighborhood, Park or open space, Library, Market, Shopping center, Religious space, Community center, Memorial or historic site, Restaurant, Performing Arts space, Other community space\nSingle select\n\n\nHow do you interact with this space?\nTo spend time with family, To spend time with friends, To exercise, For recreation, To shop, To learn, To worship, Other\nMultiple select\n\n\nHow important is this place to you?\n\nRating\n\n\nHow many times per week do you visit this place?\n\nNumber\n\n\nWhat kinds of challenges might this place face?\nClimate threats and adaptability, Funding challenges, Land use change and development, None\nMultiple select\n\n\nUpload a photo of this location\n\nImage\n\n\n\nScottish Context Examples: - For “What kind of place is this?” you might add: Village hall, Distillery, Castle/Historic site, Farmers market, Pub, Community sports club, Gaelic cultural center - For challenges: “Highland depopulation,” “Tourism pressure,” “Language preservation needs,” “Weather-related access issues”\n\n\n1.3.4 Step 4: Determine Sample Size\nConsider how many responses you need to answer your research question effectively. Also consider potential data bias - does your sample represent the population you’re trying to understand?\nTask: - Decide how many data points you need to collect and from how many different people - Set a goal as a class for how many data points you need to collect and how many people you should survey\nImportant Note: Be aware of data bias. If you only survey your classmates, your data will tell you what’s important to people your age, but may not represent the broader community.",
