These layers are also the basis for geographic analysis to aid in decision making. You will create a map layer by adding your .csv file to an empty map.\n\nSign in to your ArcGIS account using your university credentials.\nOn the ribbon, click the Map tab.\nIn Map Viewer, in the Layers pane, click the arrow next to the Add button and click Add layer from file.\n\n\nThe Add Layer window appears.\n\n\nDrag the DetroitSchoolCharacteristics.csv file to the Add Layer window.\n\n\nTip: Alternatively, click Your device and browse to the .csv file.\n\n\nFor How would you like to add this file, choose Create a hosted feature layer and add it to the map. Click Next.\n\nA list of fields appears. Map layers consist of spatial and tabular information. The table will contain the same columns—also called fields or attributes—as the .csv file. On this page, you can choose which fields from the .csv file you want to include, provide display names, and data type information.\nThe software automatically detected the fields and produced default display name and data types. This page is an opportunity for you to review that the automatic assignments are accurate.\n\nIn this example, you will choose to include all the fields, so you won’t adjust the check boxes.\nDisplay name sets a nickname or shortened name of the field name that is more readily understandable to others. Field names cannot include spaces or numbers, so sometimes you may want these in the display name. Setting Display name allows you to provide meaningful names without changing the Field name text.\nType describes the data you will store in the field: - Date—Date and time. - Double—Numbers with decimal places. - Integer—Whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (long integer). - Big Integer—Whole numbers between -(2^53) and 2^53. - String—Any sequence of characters. The default length is 256 characters.\nYou will accept all the default settings and continue.\n\nClick Next.\n\nThe Location settings page appears. Spatial information for the layer will be derived from the Latitude and Longitude columns in the .csv file.\n\nNote: If your table contains the names or addresses of locations (like Paris or 15 Central St. Bethlehem, PA) instead of latitude and longitude fields, try this tutorial about geocoding data: Convert a list of historic places into a map.\n\n\nClick Next.\nFor Title, type “Detroit high schools” followed by your name or initials (for example “Detroit high school (Your name)”).\n\n\nNote: You cannot create two layers in an ArcGIS organization with the same name. Adding your initials to a layer name ensures that other people in your organization can also complete this tutorial. Once a layer has been created, you can rename it in the map to remove your initials, which will not affect the name of the underlying data layer.\n\n\nClick Create and add to map.\n\n\nThe new layer appears on the map. The map displays the locations of the schools listed in the .csv file. Each school is considered a feature in the layer. You have access to the descriptive information, or attributes, by viewing pop-ups for features on the map.\n\nOn the map, click any circle.\n\nA pop-up window appears with information about the school from the layer’s table.\n\nClose the pop-up.\n\n\nBefore you continue, you will save the map.\n\nIn the Contents pane, click Save and open and click Save as.\n\nIn the Save map window, enter the following:\n\nFor Title, type “Public high schools in Detroit”.\nFor Summary, type “Map of public high schools and student body race and ethnicity data in Detroit, Michigan”.\n\n\nClick Save.",

For example, the school with the largest number of students eligible for FRPM programs is Western International High School in southwest Detroit. Many of the schools have a high percentage of students who identify as Black or African American. In southwest Detroit, there are more schools with higher percentages of Hispanic or Latino students.\nBy saving your map, you also created a corresponding item page that contains information, actions, options, and settings for the map.\n\nOn the Contents toolbar, click Map properties. In the Map Properties pane, click Item details.\n\n\nYour map’s item page opens in a new browser tab. The item details are missing important attribution and descriptive information that you will fill in before you share the map. For example, you must give credit to the data providers.\n\nScroll to the bottom of the page. Next to Credits (Attribution), click Edit.\nType National Center for Education Statistics’ (NCES) Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE). Click Save.\nClose the item page’s tab.",

Now that you have the data mapped, you have more ideas for how to share and explore potential after-school program needs in your city.\nYou can create a web app to display your map data in an interactive way so viewers can explore the data without editing the map. There are many ways you can use your web map to visualize data, understand problems, determine informed solutions, and discover what else is possible.\nYou can find more tutorials in the tutorial gallery.",
