    "section": "",
    "text": "About this site\nThis online book has been developed as part of the module SD2005 – From Sustainable Development to Human Security at the School of Geography and Sustainable Development, University of St Andrews. It includes a set of five practical labs designed to introduce you to essential skills in geographic information systems (GIS), using ArcGIS Online—one of the most widely adopted Cloud-based GIS platforms in both academia and industry.\nThe labs included here are adapted from Esri’s Learn ArcGIS resources and have been tailored to complement the module’s lecture content on spatial data, sustainable development, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through these hands-on exercises, you will gain practical experience working with spatial data—learning how to create interactive web maps, manage geospatial datasets, conduct spatial analysis, and build simple web applications to communicate geographic insights.\nUnderstanding how to work with spatial data is a crucial skill in addressing complex global challenges. The SDGs are inherently spatial in nature: poverty, climate change, inequality, and sustainable urban development all occur in specific places and vary across geographic regions. Practising the use of spatial data allows you to explore these patterns, reveal hidden relationships, and support evidence-based decision-making processes that are vital for sustainable development planning and human security.\nAs part of your coursework, you will complete these labs in pairs and submit a technical report (get all the instructions to create this data report in the module handbook available in Moodle). This report must demonstrate your understanding and application of GIS concepts, including screenshots and descriptions of the maps or apps you create. You are encouraged to begin working on the labs from the very first week, as the technical components may require time and independent effort outside of scheduled lectures.\nAll students enrolled in SD2005 have access to the University’s ArcGIS Online Organisational Account using their University credentials. To get started, please log in at: 👉 https://uostandrews.maps.arcgis.com",

    "text": "Why Spatial Data Matters for the SDGs\nSpatial data is essential for advancing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) because it provides a crucial geographic lens through which global challenges can be better understood, monitored, and addressed. From poverty and food insecurity to urban resilience and climate change, the spatial dimension of sustainable development helps identify where interventions are most urgently needed, how different indicators interrelate across space and time, and what progress is being made at various scales—local, national, and global.\nGeospatial information allows us to move beyond abstract statistics and instead interact with real-world patterns—making data visible, tangible, and actionable. For instance, web dashboards powered by geospatial data enable stakeholders to track SDG indicators in near real-time, providing dynamic visualizations that combine charts, maps, and open datasets. These tools support data-driven decision-making by offering interactive interfaces for understanding spatial disparities and highlighting areas that require targeted policy or humanitarian response.\nGeospatial data is not just a complement to SDG monitoring—it is key. Access to open data sources, such as those published by national governments, the United Nations, and development agencies, has democratised the availability of high-quality spatial information. Students, researchers, NGOs, and policymakers alike can now explore and analyse global issues from a geospatial perspective. This access empowers users not only to consume information but also to create spatial narratives, develop analytical tools, and contribute meaningfully to SDG implementation.\nAt the centre of this framework lies Geographic Information Systems (GIS)—and increasingly, Cloud GIS platforms like ArcGIS Online. Providing the infrastructure to visualize, manipulate, analyse, and share spatial data seamlessly across devices and locations. Whether you are mapping deforestation hotspots, analysing access to clean water, or visualizing urban inequality, Cloud GIS fosters collaboration, accessibility, and spatial intelligence at scale.",

    "text": "Part 1: Design Your Project\n\nStep 1: Formulate a Research Question\nBefore collecting any data, you need to establish a clear research question that will guide your entire project. Your research question should address: Why are you collecting data? What do you want to know?\n\n\nTask: Write a research question to guide your project about important places in your community.\nExamples: - What places in my community have social, economic, and political value and add to my community’s identity? - What places in my community contribute to its identity?\nScottish Context: - What places in Edinburgh contribute most to the city’s cultural identity beyond the obvious tourist attractions? - How do community spaces in Glasgow neighborhoods support local resilience and social cohesion? - What locations in the Scottish Highlands are most valued by local residents for their cultural and economic importance?\n\n\nStep 2: Plan Your Data Collection\nNow that you have your research question, consider what kinds of data you need to collect. Think about the who, what, when, where, and why of your data collection.\n\n\nTask: Write five sample questions that you can use to collect data to answer your research question.\nExample Questions: - What is the name of this place? - Why is it important to you? - What activities do you do at this place? - How often do you visit here? - Who is there with you? - How many people are typically there with you?\n\n\nStep 3: Consider Data Types\nDifferent types of questions collect different types of data (numbers, text, dates, rating scales, images). Planning your data types in advance will make analysis easier later.\n\n\nTask: Write 5 survey questions, keeping in mind your research question and the types of data you want to collect about each location.\nSample Survey Questions Table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nOptions\nData Type\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the name of this place?\n\nText\n\n\nWhere is this place?\n\nMap\n\n\nWhat kind of place is this?\nSchool, Neighborhood, Park or open space, Library, Market, Shopping center, Religious space, Community center, Memorial or historic site, Restaurant, Performing Arts space, Other community space\nSingle select\n\n\nHow do you interact with this space?\nTo spend time with family, To spend time with friends, To exercise, For recreation, To shop, To learn, To worship, Other\nMultiple select\n\n\nHow important is this place to you?\n\nRating\n\n\nHow many times per week do you visit this place?\n\nNumber\n\n\nWhat kinds of challenges might this place face?\nClimate threats and adaptability, Funding challenges, Land use change and development, None\nMultiple select\n\n\nUpload a photo of this location\n\nImage\n\n\n\nScottish Context: For “What kind of place is this?” you might add: Village hall, Distillery, Castle/Historic site, Farmers market, Pub, Community sports club, Gaelic cultural center - For challenges: “Highland depopulation,” “Tourism pressure,” “Language preservation needs,” “Weather-related access issues”\n\n\nStep 4: Determine Sample Size\nConsider how many responses you need to answer your research question effectively. Also consider potential data bias - does your sample represent the population you’re trying to understand?\n\n\nTask: Decide how many data points you need to collect and from how many different people - Set a goal as a class for how many data points you need to collect and how many people you should survey\nNote: Be aware of data bias. If you only survey your classmates, your data will tell you what’s important to people your age, but may not represent the broader community.",

Growing up without consistent nutrition, shelter, and safety can have long-lasting developmental impacts on children and can cause lifelong problems.\n\nScottish Context: In Scotland, child poverty affects approximately 24% of children (around 240,000 children), with particular concentrations in areas like Glasgow, Dundee, and parts of Edinburgh. The Scottish Government has committed to reducing child poverty to less than 10% by 2030 through the Child Poverty (Scotland) Act 2017.\n\nIn 2015, the United Nations and world leaders developed a series of goals to improve situations for people, places and environments globally. In total, there are 17 Sustainable Development Goals that nations are striving to meet by 2035.

    "text": "Step 1: Visualize Global Poverty\nSustainable Development Goal 1, “No Poverty” is achieved when we “End poverty in all its forms everywhere,” and “should be understood as deprivation beyond the lack of income and resources to ensure a sustainable livelihood.”\n\nKey Definition: Poverty is felt through hunger, malnutrition, limited access to basic services and educational opportunities, social discrimination and exclusion. In order to secure a future of sustainable economic growth, it is essential for countries to promote economic equality.\n\n\nTask 1.1: Understanding SDG Goal 1\n\nVisit the UN Sustainable Development site.\nMost of the data for the Sustainable Development Goals is curated and maintained by the UN Statistics Division. There are also countries that host their own open data portals featured on the data page.\nScroll down and find the section called Sustainable Development Goals, click the first goal, No Poverty.\nFamiliarize yourself with this goal - take some time to understand what this goal is about and why it is the first goal.\n\n\n\nScottish Policy Example: Scotland’s approach to SDG 1 includes the Scottish Child Payment (£25 per week per child under 16), free school meals, and targeted support for families in the most deprived areas. The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is used to identify areas requiring priority intervention.\n\n\n\nTask 1.2: Accessing UN Data Portal\n\nAfter you get a better understanding about the main facts that you can measure within this goal, now let’s apply the geographical approach to create web maps and apps that help you represent spatial data related to this goal.\nGo to https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/dataportal/database and get the data related to the 1.1.1 indicator. Which corresponds to Proportion of population below international poverty line (%) –&gt; $2.15 per day. Once you are in the portal, follow the next options to get the required data.\nIn the Data Series type or select the 1.1.1 Indicator, in the Countries, areas or Regions section, click on Countries or Areas, and for Period make sure you selected only the 2017 year. (you should have around 783 observations). Click Show Results.\n\n\nExpected Result: You will see a couple of tabs open up at the bottom corresponding to: - Proportion of population below international poverty line (%) SI_POV_DAY1 - Employed population below international poverty line, by sex and age (%) SI_POV_EMP1 indicators\nExpand the SI_POV_DAY1 tab. At this point you should have a preview of a table that includes countries and 2017 poverty values. Now click Download XLS.\n\n\n\nTask 1.3: Data Preparation\n\nOpen the downloaded file - you will see several countries are duplicated, due to data being collected at different scales (e.g., Sex, Location, Age). Filter the data to show only:\n\nSex: BOTHSEX\nLocation: ALLAREA\nAge: ALLAGE\n\nNow you should have 75 records. Save the filtered table as a new Excel file (name it 1_1_1_indicator_filtered.xlsx).\n\n\nImportant Note: Data filtering is crucial for accurate spatial analysis. In Scotland, similar filtering would be applied when working with data from the Scottish Government’s statistics portal, ensuring consistency across geographic areas and demographic groups.\n\n\n\nTask 1.4: Creating a Feature Layer in ArcGIS Online\n\nGo to ArcGIS Online, sign up with your university credentials and go to Content. Now you will upload the filtered Excel file and create a Feature Layer with the data you downloaded and filtered.\nClick New Item\n\nDrag and drop your file or choose Device option and select the filtered Excel file (e.g., 1_1_1_indicator_filtered.xlsx)\nWhen ArcGIS Online asks “How would you like to add this file?” Select the first option: Add and create a hosted feature layer or table. Click Next.\nIn the Field Box, the 13 columns are selected - no need to do anything here, just click Next.\nIn the Location Settings, select Addresses or place names. Open the Advanced location settings and select World in the Region box. Now in Location fields, make sure Location information is in one field is selected. Then in front of Address or Place, select the Field GeoAreaName, click Next.\n\n⚠️ Credit Usage Warning: You will use approximately 3 Credits from your ArcGIS Online Account for this geocoding process.\n\nFinally, provide a title, tag, and summary of the feature layer you are creating. Click Save.\nArcGIS Online will host your Excel file, geocode all the rows based on the name of the country (that’s why it uses credits) and then create a feature layer (the spatial data) that you can use to create web maps based on that indicator.\nIf you get a warning/notification, please click YES.\n\n\n\n\nTask 1.5: Correcting Geocoding Errors\n\nCommon Issue: One common problem in geocoding when using names is that you could get locations in places that do not correspond to the intended place. ArcGIS Online provides a way to correct those mislocated places.\n\n\nOnce you have the Map Viewer open, you will notice that Georgia has been automatically coded to be in the USA.\n\nUsing the table at the bottom, locate Georgia and select it. You will see on your left a list of all the potential candidates that ArcGIS Online used to geocode Georgia. If you click on the third option, you will realize that one is the correct match (the country Georgia, not the US state). Click Match and then Done Reviewing.\n\n\n\nScottish Example: Similar geocoding issues might occur with place names like “Perth” (which could be matched to Perth, Australia instead of Perth, Scotland) or “Hamilton” (which might be matched to Hamilton, Canada instead of Hamilton, Scotland).\n\n\nOnce your geocoding process has finished, your map should look like this:\n\n\nObservation: You will notice that most of the African countries have not reported any data, but here is when we can use and merge other data sources. We can use data reported by the World Bank to merge with the data you have geocoded.\n\n\nTask 1.6: Adding Additional Data Sources\n\nClick Add and Search For Layers to look for a published service. Make sure you have My Organization selected, and then type latest_africa_poverty_data, and add the layer published by mfbp1_UoStAndrews.\n\n\n\n\nClick Details again to see the table of contents with the two layers you have added to your map or click the back arrow to close the pane. In the Contents pane, hover over your latest_africa_poverty_data layer and click the Perform Analysis button.\n\n\n\n\nThen in Manage Data, select Merge Layers.\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you have selected your poverty data layers and add a clear title (e.g., poverty_data_1_1_1_indicator). Important: Don’t forget to uncheck the “Use current map extent” option. Click Run Analysis.\n\n\nProcessing Note: Give ArcGIS Online some time to process your analysis, and you will have a single layer that joins the poverty data for most of the countries.\n\nTechnical Tip: A key aspect you need to consider for future data joins is ensuring how the attributes will be joined. In this case, both poverty values are included as integers and the heading is called “2017”, which has allowed us to have one single column with the values we need to plot a world poverty map.\n\n\n\nClick Save to save the current web map to your account. Add the title: “Indicator 1.1.1: Proportion of population below the international poverty line (percent)”\n\n\n\nTask 1.7: Converting Points to Polygons\nCurrent Issue: The data appears as points, but to better visualize it, the data should be converted to polygons.\n\nOn the ribbon Layers, click Add, then click Living Atlas Layers. Search for “world countries” and add one of Esri’s World Countries layers by clicking the plus.\n\n\n\n\nClick the back arrow to close the pane. In the Contents pane, hover over your World Countries layer and click the Perform Analysis button.\n\n\n\nOn the Perform Analysis pane, expand Summarize Data, then click Join Features.\nConfigure the join as follows:\n\nNumber 1, Choose target layer: Set to World Countries\nChoose layer to join to target layer: Choose the Indicator 1.1.1 layer\nSelect the type(s) of join: Click Choose a spatial relationship and choose Intersects\nChoose join operation: Make sure Join one to one is selected\n\n\n\n\nName the layer World Poverty, uncheck the “Use current map extent” box, and click Run Analysis.\n\nResult: When the analysis finishes, the layer will be added to the map. By default, all the countries are shown in the same color. To see the data, you’ll change the symbology to show a choropleth map.\n\n\nTask 1.8: Creating a Choropleth Map\n\nUncheck all layers except for World Poverty, then hover over the World Poverty layer and click the Change Style button.\n\n\n\nOn the Change Style pane, expand the Choose an attribute to show menu and choose 2017.\n\nUnderstanding the Data: “2017” is the attribute that shows the latest reported value for any country that has reported data. The countries are symbolized with a default graduated color scheme that shows low values in light yellow and high values in dark blue. The light yellows blend into the basemap, so before analyzing the map, you’ll change the symbology.\n\n\nFor Counts and Amounts (Color) click Options, then click Symbols. Choose a color ramp that stands out from the basemap. If necessary, click Invert to show the higher values in darker colors.\n\n\n\n\nInitial Analysis Results\nVisual Analysis Findings: From a visual analysis, it appears that: - Europe, North America, and South America (partially) have the lowest levels of poverty - Several African countries report high levels of poverty - Some countries (such as Libya and Saudi Arabia) haven’t reported data for this metric\n\nScottish Context: Scotland, as part of the UK, would appear in the low poverty category on this global map, but this masks internal variations. Areas like the Glasgow conurbation, parts of Dundee, and some rural Highland communities experience higher poverty rates that would be visible in a more detailed, national-scale analysis.\n\n\nClick OK, then Done and save the map.\n\n\n⚠️ Important Reminder: Always remember to save your map - ArcGIS Online does not automatically save your work, so constantly remember to save your progress!",

When users select a province in the province selector, it will filter the city selector to only show cities within that province.\nExpand the Filter section\nTurn on City selector and set:\n\nSource field: Province Postal Abbreviation\nTarget field: State\n\n\nTurn on filter actions for Electric Charging Stations, Operational stations indicator, and Station table\nFor each, set Source field to Province Postal Abbreviation and Target field to State\n\nFor Station table, check Render only when filtered\n\nYou’ll add one more action to the province selector, to make the map zoom to the selected province.\nExpand Zoom section and turn on Electric charging stations in Canada\n\nClick Done\nThe dashboard looks the same as before, except that the table has been replaced by a message.\n\nYou’ll test that the actions you configured are working as expected.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Test Province Selector\n\nClick Select a province and choose Prince Edward Island\nObserve how the map zooms, table populates, and indicator updates\nClick Select a city to see only relevant cities listed\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Configure City and Connector Selector Actions\n\nConfigure City selector:\n\nPoint to City selector, click options, and Configure\nClick Actions tab, expand Filter section\nTurn on Connector selector, Electric Charging Stations, Operational stations indicator, and Station table\nClick Done\n\n\nConfigure Connector selector:\n\nPoint to Connector selector, click options, and Configure\nClick Actions tab, expand Filter section\nTurn on Electric Charging Stations, Operational stations indicator, and Station table\n\nYou don’t need to define matching fields this time because all of the connected elements are based on the same layer: Electric charging stations in Canada.\nClick Done\nIn the Layout pane, point to Connector selector, click the options button, and click Configure.\nClick the Actions tab and expand the Filter section.\nTurn on Electric Charging Stations, Operational stations indicator, and Station table.\n\nClick Done.\nYou’ll test that the actions behave as expected together.\nIf necessary, on the header, click Select a province and choose Prince Edward Island.\nClick Select a city and choose Charlottetown.\nThe map, table, and indicator all update to show fewer stations.\n\nOn the header, click Select connector type.\n\nThe list has fewer options than before.\nIn the connector selector, click TESLA.\nThe map, table, and indicator all update to show fewer stations.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Configure Table Actions\nThe last actions you will configure are on the table. The table only populates once a province is selected on the header. Similarly, you will ensure that the details element only populates when a station is selected in the table. Otherwise, viewers will see details for stations that are probably not relevant to them. When there is no selection on the table, the message you configured earlier will display.\n\nIn the View pane, click the Body tab\nPoint to Station table, click options, and Configure\n\nClick Actions tab, expand Filter section\nTurn on Station details and check Render only when filtered\n\nExpand Flash section and turn on Electric charging stations in Canada\nExpand Zoom section and turn on Electric charging stations in Canada\nClick Done\nOn the dashboard, click any row in the table.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Test Complete Functionality\n\nSelect Prince Edward Island from province selector\nSelect Charlottetown from city selector\nSelect TESLA from connector selector\nClick any row in the table to see details populate and map zoom/flash",

    "text": "Final Steps:\nWell Done! You have now completed all the steps for this lab. Before moving on, make sure to:\n\nTake one screenshot of the final map. Ensuring your full screen is visible, including the date and time. This screenshot will be required for your report ( see all the instructions in the handbook). Dashboard fully loaded - showing all elements working - Demonstration of functionality - show the dashboard with: - A province selected - A city selected - A connector type selected - Station details displayed - Table populated with filtered results.\nFor the Part B of this lab in your report. Replicate the process independently by applying the same skills you practised in this lab, but using spatial data from Scotland or the UK.\n\nIn the original lab, you have created a operational dashboard. For your independent spatial analysis, you can choose a different theme and dataset (e.g. healthcare access, education, environmental risk), as long as you also:\n\nUse again ArcGIS Online Dashboards using your university credentials. Meet and work with your classmate to define which account want to use . You must only report one independent analysis results.\nApply the same techniques learned in this lab., and create another operational dashboard app, to represent the thematic of your preference.\nInclude the screenshot of the new dashboard created with a clear purpose relevant to a real-world issue in Scotland or the UK. Ensuring your full screen is visible, including the date and time. This screenshot will be required for your report. As you did for the first screenshot, make sure you the dashboard is fully loaded - showing all elements working - demonstrate the functionality - show the dashboard with: - List section, items details displayed - table populated with filtered results. Take a full screen screenshot (not just browser window) 5. Include this screenshot with your report (see the instructions in the handbook)\n\nThis additional task is an opportunity to improve your technical skills, explore new datasets, and demonstrate your ability to adapt spatial analysis methods to new contexts.\n\nScottish Context Examples:\nHere are some examples of potential operational dashboards you could create for the Scottish contexts:\n- Renewable energy monitoring (wind farms, solar installations)\n- Tourism infrastructure (attractions, accommodation, transport links)\n- Public transport optimization (bus routes, train connections, ferry services)\n- Environmental monitoring (air quality, weather stations, flood warnings)\n- Economic development (business locations, employment centers, investment zones)\n\nTutorial inspired from https://learn.arcgis.com/en/projects/build-an-interactive-dashboard/",
