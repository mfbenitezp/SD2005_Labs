# About this site {.unnumbered}

This online book has been developed as part of the module **SD2005 â€“ From Sustainable Development to Human Security** at the School of Geography and Sustainable Development, University of St Andrews. It includes a set of five practical labs designed to introduce you to essential skills in geographic information systems (GIS), using **ArcGIS Online**â€”one of the most widely adopted Cloud-based GIS platforms in both academia and industry.

The labs included here are adapted from Esriâ€™s *Learn ArcGIS* resources and have been tailored to complement the module's lecture content on spatial data, sustainable development, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through these hands-on exercises, you will gain practical experience working with spatial dataâ€”learning how to create interactive web maps, manage geospatial datasets, conduct spatial analysis, and build simple web applications to communicate geographic insights.

Understanding how to work with spatial data is a crucial skill in addressing complex global challenges. The SDGs are inherently spatial in nature: poverty, climate change, inequality, and sustainable urban development all occur in specific places and vary across geographic regions. Practising the use of spatial data allows you to explore these patterns, reveal hidden relationships, and support evidence-based decision-making processes that are vital for sustainable development planning and human security.

As part of your coursework, you will complete these labs in pairs and submit a **technical report (get all the instructions to create this data report in the module handbook available in Moodle)**. This report must demonstrate your understanding and application of GIS concepts, including screenshots and descriptions of the maps or apps you create. You are encouraged to begin working on the labs from the very first week, as the technical components may require time and independent effort outside of scheduled lectures.

All students enrolled in SD2005 have access to the University's ArcGIS Online **Organisational Account** using their University credentials. To get started, please log in at: ðŸ‘‰ [https://uostandrews.maps.arcgis.com](https://uostandrews.maps.arcgis.com/)
