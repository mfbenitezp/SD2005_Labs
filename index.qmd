# About this site {.unnumbered}

This book has been developed as part of the module **SD2005 â€“ From Sustainable Development to Human Security** at the School of Geography and Sustainable Development, University of St Andrews. It includes a set of five practical labs designed to introduce students to essential skills in geographic information systems (GIS), using **ArcGIS Online**â€”one of the most widely adopted Cloud-based GIS platforms in both academia and industry.

The SD2005 module includes a variaty of lectures from different types of topics, but also includes two weeks and six lectures related to the use of spatial data to the study and monitoring of the SGDs. The labs included here have been tailored to complement the module's lecture content on spatial data, sustainable development, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

The material and instrucctions here are an adapted version of several turorials from Esriâ€™s *Learn ArcGIS* resources. Through these hands-on exercises, you will gain practical experience working with spatial dataâ€”learning how to create interactive web maps, manage geospatial datasets, conduct spatial analysis, and build simple web applications to communicate geographic insights.

As part of your coursework, you have to complete the labs included here, in pairs and submit a **technical report in PDF (get all the instructions to create this data report in the module handbook available in Moodle)**. This report must demonstrate your understanding and application of GIS concepts, including screenshots and descriptions of the maps or apps you create. You are encouraged to begin working on the labs from the very first week, as the technical components may require time and independent effort outside of scheduled lectures.

All students enrolled in SD2005 have access to the University's ArcGIS Online **Organisational Account** using their University credentials. To get started, please log in at: ðŸ‘‰ [https://uostandrews.maps.arcgis.com](https://uostandrews.maps.arcgis.com/)
